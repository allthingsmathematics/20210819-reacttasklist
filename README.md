Summary
-Starting off with two hooks on global app level
-first hook “showAddTask” is whether the “add task” form is being shown, it is initially set to a false state, and once the add button is clicked, it is then set to true, the add form is shown, and the button changes from “add” to “close”…..when close button is clicked, the “showAddTask” state gets set back to false, and the add form closes

-second hook on the global app level is “taskList” which is an array of tasks, starts initially off with 3 tasks
-you can double click each task to toggle “reminder” to be true or false, if it is true, then a green sidebar appears beside the task
-you can click the “x” icon beside any task to delete it out of the array


-there are also 3 hooks (text, day, reminder boolean) within the AddTask component…these start changing as you type into the AddTask form. When the “Save Task” button is clicked, a new entry into the global “taskList” array is added with the inputs





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
